For this project I made a header, body and footer. 
There is a nav bar with buttons which will direct the user to the section below which it is referring to. 
I added a background image.
I added a div with 6 placeholders for projects. 
I added 3 projects, linking them to the html using a tags.
I added screenshots of each project to the boxes in css.
I used flexbox to make the boxes the correct size on the page.
I linked my gitHub and linkedIn to the buttons on the bottom of the page. 
I used the style sheet to make elements the desired colors/ sizes.
